This is a great stack, following https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch, with:
- Yarn as package manager and task runner,
- ESlint,
- FlowType for JS type annotations,
- Babel to transpile and allow all these tools to work together,
- jest and husky to create and automatically run tests,
- pm2 to daemonize our server,
- nodemon and Express,
- Webpack to bundle our modules,
- ES6 for nice modules, Promises, etc.,
- Hot Module Replacement to speed up Webpack in dev
